Shopping Cart Built in React JS with Context API and useReducer
A React.js shopping cart website is a web application that allows users to browse, add and remove items from their cart, and proceed to checkout. It typically features a user-friendly interface built with React components and hooks, allowing for smooth navigation and dynamic updates to the cart as items are added or removed. The website may also include features such as product filtering and sorting, account creation and login, and integration with payment gateway for secure transactions.
